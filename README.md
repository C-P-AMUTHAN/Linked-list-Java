# Java Linked List Programs

This repository contains Java implementations of various linked list data structures, including operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and search. Linked lists are fundamental in data structure studies and widely used in various applications.

## Linked List Implementations

- **Singly Linked List**: A linear collection of nodes where each node points to the next one in the sequence.
- **Doubly Linked List**: A linked list where each node contains pointers to both the next and previous nodes, allowing traversal in both directions.
- **Circular Linked List**: A linked list where the last node points back to the first node, forming a circular structure.
  
## Operations Included

- **Insertion**: Adding elements at the beginning, end, or a specific position.
- **Deletion**: Removing elements from the beginning, end, or a specific position.
- **Traversal**: Visiting each node in the list to access or display elements.
- **Search**: Finding an element in the linked list.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/C-P-AMUTHAN/Linked-list-Java.git
